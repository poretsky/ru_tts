.TH RU_TTS 1 "August 19, 2021"
.SH NAME
ru_tts \- software Russian TTS engine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ru_tts
.RI [ options ]
.br
.B ru_speak
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B ru_tts
and
.B ru_speak
commands.
.PP
\fBru_tts\fP is a program that takes Russian text in \fBkoi8\-r\fP
charset on its standard input and produces digital sound stream in
the raw linear signed 8-bit 10 kHz format on the standard output.
.PP
Symbols \(oq+\(cq and \(oq=\(cq immediately after a vowel in input
text are treated as strong and weak stress sign respectively.
.PP
\fBru_speak\fP is a simple wrapper around \fBru_tts\fP. It takes
Russian text on its standard input, convert it into the spoken speech
and plays produced sound via \fBplay\fP utility from the \fBsox\fP
package. It accepts input text in the current locale's character
encoding taking care of proper recoding.
.SH OPTIONS
Both programs recognize the same set of options that for convenience
can be divided onto several groups.
.SH SPEECH CONTROL OPTIONS
These options affect general speech parameters. The most of them
accept numeric value as an argument. All numeric values serve as
factors applied to a default level of the corresponding parameter.
Thus, they must be positive numbers and the default value is 1.0.
Greater value proportionally increases the parameter level,
lesser value proportionally decreases it.
Reasonable value range for various options is different,
but any out of range value will be automatically reduced to the
acceptable range.
.TP
.B \-r value
.br
Set speech rate factor. Reasonable value range is from 0.2 up to 5.0.
.TP
.B \-p value
.br
Set voice pitch factor. Reasonable value range is from 0.5 up to 3.0.
.TP
.B \-e value
.br
Set speech emotionality factor. Reasonable value range is from 0.0
(absolutely monotone speech without intonations) up to 1.4.
.TP
.B \-g value
.br
Set interclause gaps duration factor. If this value is immediately
prepended by one of the following punctuations \(oq,\(cq, \(oq.\(cq,
\(oq;\(cq, \(oq:\(cq, \(oq?\(cq, \(oq!\(cq, the factor will be applied
only to the gaps implied by that punctuation. If the value is
prepended by symbol \(oq-\(cq, it will be used for intonational gaps
not caused by any punctuation. Otherwise all interclause gaps will be
affected. Use this option several times to adjust various gaps. Lower
boundary of the reasonable value range is always 0.0, but the upper
one greatly depends on the value prepending symbol and actual speech
rate.
.TP
.B \-a
.br
Use an alternative (female) voice instead of the default one.
.SH NUMBERS INTERPRETATION CONTROL OPTIONS
By default point and comma inside a number both are interpreted
as decimal separator. But this behaviour can be changed.
.TP
.B \-d.
.br
Only point should be treated as decimal separator.
.TP
.B \-d,
.br
Only comma should be treated as decimal separator.
.TP
.B \-d\-
.br
Disable decimal separators treating. In that case integer and
fractional parts will be interpreted as two distinct integer numbers.
.SH PRONUNCIATION DICTIONARY RELATED OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-s path
.br
Points location of stress and pronunciation dictionary to use. You may
use pronunciation dictionary shipped with the package \fBrulex\fP here.
.TP
.B \-l file
.br
Save words that were not found in the dictionary in specified file. It
is useful for dictionary developing. This option does matter only when
the pronunciation dictionary itself is used.
.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
.br
Show program name and version.
.TP
.B \-h
.br
Show summary of options.
